                    Information systems (IS) are changing work practices, reshaping 
                    organizations, transforming cultures, and giving new meaning to the ways 
                    we see the world. This course is designed to help students understand the 
                    role of IS in the enterprise and the means by which these systems are 
                    created, utilized and maintained. The course will focus on enterprise 
                    information architecture including the components of enterprise strategy, 
                    business, application, information, and infrastructure layers. This course 
                    provides not only a framework for understanding information systems, but 
                    also a language to identify their dynamic complexities and interdependencies.

                    For students with a basic understanding of programming 
                    (variables, expressions, loops, arrays, functions). Teaches 
                    imperative programming and methods for ensuring the correctness 
                    of programs. Students will learn the process and concepts needed to go
                    from high-level descriptions of algorithms to correct imperative 
                    implementations, with specific application to basic data structures 
                    and algorithms.

                <td>
                    This course introduces the basic concepts, ideas and tools involved in 
                    doing mathematics. As such, its main focus is on presenting informal logic, 
                    and the methods of mathematical proof. These subjects are closely related 
                    to the application of mathematics in many areas, particularly computer 
                    science. Topics discussed include a basic introduction to elementary number 
                    theory, induction, the algebra of sets, relations, equivalence relations, 
                    congruences, partitions, and functions, including injections, surjections, 
                    and bijections. A basic introduction to the real numbers, rational and 
                    irrational numbers. Supremum and infimum of a set.

                    What is the relationship between an individual person and 
                    collective memories? How do societies "remember"? This course 
                    proposes an interdisciplinary approach to the relationship between 
                    memory and history. It explores various ways in which societies have 
                    mobilized their remembrances of the past for political and economic 
                    ends in the present; how and whose memory began to matter in a global 
                    20th century; and how individual testimonies have highlighted the role
                    of body, experience, trauma, and nostalgia for writing new, more 
                    inclusive and heterogenous histories.
